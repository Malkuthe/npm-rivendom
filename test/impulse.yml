traits:
  building-ire:
    name: Building Ire
    description: Each time the impulse takes damage during a turn, it gains an amount of Ire equal to the damage it took. It loses all Ire at the end of the turn.
  unstable-constitution:
    name: Unstable Constitution
    description: At the end of each of its turns, the impulse loses 5 hit points. This loss of hit points does not trigger Building Ire,  does not grant any Ire to the impulse, and occurs after the impulse loses any Ire it has.
  wrothful-expiration:
    name: Wrothful Expiration
    description: | 
      If the impulse has Ire when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes with a blast of eldritch energy. The explosion goes off in a spherical area centered around the impulse with a radius equal to the amount of Ire it has in feet rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5. 
      
      Each creature in range of the blast must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking psychic damage equal to the amount of Ire the impulse has. Other impulses fail this saving throw automatically.
